    json
    {
    "intent": null,
    "parameters": {},
    "needs_clarification": false,
    "text": null,
    "memory_update": {
        "identity": {},
        "preferences": {},
        "relationships": {},
        "emotional_state": {}
    }
    }
 
Just add really important informations in the memory like;
    - Name of the user, age, city
    - The question that user's ask mostly doesn't include memory.

return json format. 
Create really fast responses. make it quick.
